                <p>Before I fall in love with an album, before the vinyl purchase begins or the constant reminder of an album's greatness,
                    I have to be drawn into the world that the artist has created. I have to be lost in the virual world that
                    the aritst has created. The piece of work doesn't even need to be a concept album or one with extravagant features and magnificent production.
                    They add up, believe me or not, but the vibe has to be there. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The key sometimes is the intro. The welcome message that entices me to partake in the journey. The best Intros
                    can do this with a subtle use of subliminal messages that create immense suspense or they can do with with brashful beats that forcefully entrap you.

                <p>In this article, I will share with you some of my favorite songs that never fail to provide the thrilling introductions to my virtual planets.</p>

            <header>Kendrick Lamar - Blood</header>
            <!--Insert YouTube Video Here-->
            <article>
                <p>
                    The first time that I listened to this song, I was on my bed ready to be thrilled by one of the greatest rappers of
                    our generation, who had dropped one of the greatest albums of the 2010s with To Pimp A Butterfly. Throughout the song,
                    Kendrick captured my attention by providing a detailed-oriented story of how he encountered a blind woman on
                    the sidewalk, literally going nuts for no reason because she needed help finding something that she lost.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Kendrick, being the good samaritan that he is, approaches the woman to offer some help.
                    However, the story turns into something much more serious than he anticipated. The blind woman
                    strangely informs Kendrick that she is in despair because she was looking for his life. As soon as she 
                    said that, a firing gunshot is heard and then it transitions into Fox News anchors criticizing Kendrick's 
                    2015 BET performance when he stood on top of a cop car to perform the hit song, "Alright." To make matters worse,
                    the song then transitions into the sugar-high rap bars that fills his hit song, "DNA."

            <!--Insert Travis' YouTube Video Here-->
            <article>
                <p>In 2015, Travis Scott dropped his cult-classic album, Rodoe and ushered in a progressive
                    form of trap music filled with spacey beats, brashing synths and woozy vocals glazed with psychedelic autotune.
                    Travis wanted to govern a world of ragers who didn't give a flying fuck about societal rules. On "Pornography", 
                    T.I. provides an intro to detail the goal of Travis Scott to assemble all ragers. Travis' demonic-sounding voice seeks
                    to draw people into his kingdom. The second verse has Travis remind himself to take his goals seriously, but the 
                    feeling of this is accentuated by the bloodsucking synths used by Mike Dean.

            <header>SZA - Supermodel</header>
            <!--Insert the video here dumbass-->
            <article>
                <p>
                  SZA's <em>CTRL</em> album has been labeled as a modern-day classic due to its honesty, 
                  detailed storylines and memorable hits. C'mon, let's not act like we weren't out here bumping that "The Weekend"
                  song or crying to "The Garden." As much as the album represented a culture reset, the intro understood the fucking assignment.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    On "Supermodel", SZA pens a letter to her ex-lover who has since moved on without her. Yes this is 
                    nothing new in pop music, but SZA also gets back at him and claims that she also slept with his homeboy 
                    when she was in Vegas. Here, you know certain lines are being crossed and the story is getting much juicier. 
                    Honestly, the guitar and the minimal use of instumentation allowed her voice to have a deeper and more impactful role
                    on the song than most of the other ones on the album. If this doesn't entice you to continue to listen to the 
                    entire project, nothing will!

        <header>Kanye West - On Sight</header>
        <article>
            <p>
                If I ever had a chance to teleport myself into a studio session to understand what the fuck was really going on, it would have to be Kanye 
                West's recording on his intro to his most polarizing album ever, <em>Yeezus</em>. I would like to know what influenced him to choose such a violent
                sound such as the violent 808s and the minimal use of instrumentation to document his creative vision.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                "On Sight" is unlike any other Yeezy project. It can even be a huge turnoff to some dedicated fans. But that was his goal in the first place.
                To make you understand his frustration with people trying to box him into just being a musiciaan. At this point, he stresses that he doesn't give a fuck
                anynore. Kinda true, but the sound used in this song provides the perfect segway into the world of Yeezus which barely uses hooks but rather raw emotions,
                galactical beats and eccentric samples.

            <p>
                If your favorite artists don't start their albums like this, then I don't wanna even fucking hear it. The hard-hitting drums, succelent strings
                and vocoder-recorded vocals create the perfect scene for a carefree dance. The French creatives effectvely blend the disco world of the 80s with futuristic beats
                throughout the album and the intro proved this.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                They did more with less. Just a catchy hook and live instrumentation did the trick here. No need for a feature or extra verses. Everything was 
                accomplished with a smart use of recording.
